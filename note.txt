This is a portfolio page with one header and 4 secions of 100vh min-height.

fontawesome: version used 5.15.4. so make sure choose this same version for any icon snippets

short-cut:  $  ==> for <div class="control control-1 active-btn"></div>
                    <div class="control control-2 active-btn"></div>
                    <div class="control control-3 active-btn"></div>
                    <div class="control control-4 active-btn"></div>
                    <div class="control control-5 active-btn"></div>

        type:     .control.control-$.active-btn*5     The $ sign will auto generate incremented numbers from 1

by installing the extension of sass and its live compiler, I have created a style.scss file. Click "watch sass" button at the bottom bar of vscode, 
        'style.css' and 'style.css.map' files are generated automatically and updated constantly while 'watching'.

data-id etc. CSS data attibute - author-self-created attr, is used for the 'control' buttons. All buttons are fixed display.

To center the content: display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;

To make circle: backgroud-color:red; width: 55px; height:55px; border-radius: 50%;

Fat arrow function "this" refers to the 'window' object, so in TogglePages() in app.js, the 'secBtn[i].classList.add' 
        is used instead of 'this.classList.add'

for <i> , set its 'pointer-events:none;' because when the div button is clicked, <i> as event.target needs to be silent,
        so that only the parent <div> is for sure the event.target, this parent <div> has data-id, to access this, event.target.dataset 
        is used. 

/** ANIMATION **/
@keyframes: adding 'forwards' will lock the last frame on screen, so that no need to add the last transition like 'transform: translateY(0) scale(1);' in the section

psudo element needs to provide content, for background, set absolute and 0 for each direction to cover whole screen, z-index to -1.

For multiple layers of background, the order is from front to back. 

Add animation to a website, the best way is to use css opacity + transform instead of javascript or embed videos or GIF, for performance persective

By applying different animation speeds for multi animations, the combined result is dramatic.

Timing functions in CSS: ease in, ease out, liner, ease in out, or use cubic-bezier().com for more customized timing control.

For delay timing function such as .5s, in order to stop background from flashing before the delayed image, use 'opacity:0;'
        to remove the background color.

It is recommended to only use customized timing function for animation, not ease in or out built in stuff.

Show staggered animation (animate one after another) by using different animation-delay on the same animation class.


/* Transition:opacity, transform  for animation effect*/

_media.scss is imported at the end of the style.scss. This is a MUST.
